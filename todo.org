#+TITLE: Notes for Specialization Store
#+CATEGORY: Specialization Store

* TODO Implement (setf store-specializations)
The method (setf store-specializations) is not implemented for the
standard store.

* TODO Define make-specialization-unbound.
This function undefines any functions and/or compiler macros installed
in the global environment by specializations.

Requires changes to make-store-unbound.

* TODO Note about run time changes.
Make a note that because specializations have the ability to inline
code, the burden of maintaining the active specializations in the
store function is placed on the user.

Similarly, for type definitions. It is permitted for a store function
to assume the types are unable to change.
